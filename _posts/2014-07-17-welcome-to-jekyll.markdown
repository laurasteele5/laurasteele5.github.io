This is my second Jekyll blog!

Tonight was the first night of class. I am not exactly 100% sure what to expect yet, but I believe that I am going to learn a lot! I think that it is going to take a lot of hardwork and patience on my part in order to become the best front-end developer/designer that I can be. I am willing and ready to learn, and can't wait to see what is to come!

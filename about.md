I have two beautiful daughters! Eden is 8, and Eve just turned 2. My amazing boyfriend, Kevin, is a software engineer. He and I are both originally from Southeast Texas, but reconnected in Austin last year.

Before beginning this course, I was a third grade teacher in Coupland, Texas. I love teaching, but I am ready for a career change! Being a teacher, I have a love for learning and this career field is ever-changing allowing me to be a forever learner.
